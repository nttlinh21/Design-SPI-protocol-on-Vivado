# Design-SPI-protocol-on-Vivado
Design an SPI module consisting of one master and one slave in Mode 0. Simulate the data transmission process between the master and slave on the waveform display. Verify the module by receiving data from the PmodALS sensor and displaying it on the ILA screen.
You should learn about the SPI protocol and the PmodALS. Reference: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/adc081s021.pdf
